Important concepts 

why use binascii , OS, Lazy translation, Model verbose

binascii : Convert between binary and ASCII

OS: os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

Lazy translation:
Use the lazy versions of translation functions in django.utils.translation (easily recognizable by the lazy suffix in their names) to translate strings lazily â€“ when the value is accessed rather than when theyâ€™re called.

These functions store a lazy reference to the string â€“ not the actual translation. The translation itself will be done when the string is used in a string context, such as in template rendering.

This is essential when calls to these functions are located in code paths that are executed at module load time.

This is something that can easily happen when defining models, forms and model forms, because Django implements these such that their fields are actually class-level attributes. For that reason, make sure to use lazy translations in the following cases:

Model fields and relationships verbose_name and help_text option values

You can mark names of ForeignKey, ManyToManyField or OneToOneField relationship as translatable by using their verbose_name options:
Just like you would do in verbose_name you should provide a lowercase verbose name text for the relation as Django will automatically titlecase it when required.

Model verbose names values:

It is recommended to always provide explicit verbose_name and verbose_name_plural options rather than relying on the fallback English-centric and somewhat naÃ¯ve determination of verbose names Django performs by looking at the modelâ€™s class name
